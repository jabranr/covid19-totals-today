## Idea behind

Almost every day, my wife and I had to look and search for different resources to find a number for total new cases and deaths due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) in past 24 hours. But it has proved to be very difficult to find such a resource. So we had been relying on whatever we could find, mostly TV briefings or Excel sheets from [official websites](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-daily-deaths/). This webpage aims to simplify this search and easily find totals about new cases and deaths around the world.
